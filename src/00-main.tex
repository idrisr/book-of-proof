	This problem concerns 4-letter codes made from the letters A, B, C, D,
	$\ldots$ Z.
	\begin{enumerate}[label = {(\arabic*)}]
		\item How many such codes can be made?
		      $26^4$, assuming repetitions.
		\item How many such codes have no two consecutive letters the same?
		      We can pick any letter to be the first one. To assure a non-consecutive
		      2nd letter, we can pick from 25 letters.  To pick a 3rd letter which is
		      non-consecutive with the 2nd letter, there are 25 choices, as it is now ok
		      to re-use the first letter. And so it goes, so that for every non-first
		      letter, there are $n-1$ choices.
		      Therefore the answer is $26\cdot 25^3$.

		\item How many such lineups are there that have at least one red card?
		      Let $A=$ list of all lineups
		      Let $B=$ list of all lineups without a red.
		      Let $C=$ list of all lineups with at least one red.
		      Therefore $|A| - |B| = |C| = \dfrac{52!}{47!} - \dfrac{26!}{21!}$
		\item How many such lineups are there in which the cards are either all

		      Let $A=$ list of all blacks.

\begin{exercise}{}{}
	Consider the integers between 1 and 9999.
	\begin{enumerate}[label = {(\arabic*)}]
		\item How many have no repeated digits?
		      Let $A=1\ldots 9$
		      Let $B=0\ldots 9$
		      For the integers $1\ldots 9$, we can pick any element from $A$, therefore
		      there are $9$ with non-consecutive digits.
		      For the integers $10\ldots 99$, we can pick any element from $A$, and then
		      and non-matching element from $B$, therefore are $9\cdot9=81$ integers in
		      this range with non-consecutive digits.
		      For the integers $C=100\ldots 999$, we can pick any element from $A$, then
		      any non-matching element from $B$, and then lastly another non-matching
		      element from $B$, therefore there are $9\cdot9\cdot9$ integers in this range
		      with non-consecutive digits.
		      For the integers $C=1000\ldots 9999$, follows the same pattern, therefore
		      there are $9\cdot9\cdot9\cdot9$ integers in this range
		      with non-consecutive digits.
		      The answer is $9^1 + 9^2 + 9^3 + 9^4$.

		\item How many have at least one repeated digit?
		      The set of numbers with at least one repeated digit is the inverse of the
		      above calculated set, namely the set of numbers with no repeated digits.
		      Therefore the answer is $9999 - 9^1 - 9^2 - 9^3 - 9^4$.

	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{enumerate}[label = {(\alph*)}]
		\item How many such length-5 lists have at least one letter repeated?
		      Herein it's easiest to use the subtraction princple, and calculate $|A|$

		      $C=A - B, \quad |C| = 5^5 - 5! $
		\item How many such length-6 lists have at least one letter repeated?
		      The same principle applies, therefore the answer is $6^6 - 6!$.

		\item All lists that fit the description will contain 2 vowels. First we can

		\item There are then $5$ locations to insert the consecutive vowels, and 2 ways

	Consider the lists of length six made with the symbols P, R, O, F, S,

		\item Within this problem there exists the subproblem of how many ways books of

		\item Next, we must determine how many ways there are to arrange sets of similar
		      books, and again it is $m!$, where $m$ is the number of subjects.
		\item Therefore there are $m! \cdot n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot n_3!$ ways to arrange the
		      books, with the constraint that books are grouped together by subject.

\section{Factorials and Permutations}
\begin{definition}{Permutation\index{permutation}}{}
	A permutation of a set is an arrangement of all of the set's elements in a
	row, that is, a list without repetition that uses every element of the set.
	For example, the permutations of the set $X=\set{1,2,3}$ are the six lists
	\begin{align*}
		\set{123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321}.
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{intuition}{Permutation}{}
	A permutation can roughly be thought of as a function from a set to a set of
	lists, wherein sets don't care about order, and lists do.  That's why there
	are so many ``versions'' of a list, but only one of a set, for a particular
	set of elements.
	\begin{haskell}{}
		permutation :: Set a -> Set (List a)
	\end{haskell}
\end{intuition}

\begin{intuition}{Permutation Cardinality}{}
	If we start with some set $A$, where $|A|=n$, then we can use the multiplication
	principle to count the number of ways to create permutations.
	\begin{align*}
		A      & := \text{set with cardinality}\;n        \\
		P(x)   & = \text{permutation operator for set}\;x \\
		|P(x)| & = n\cdot(n-1)\ldots\cdot 1               \\
		       & = n!
	\end{align*}

	set of elements.

	\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbullet}, leftmargin=*, itemsep=0pt, parsep=0pt]
		\item Each time the quantity $10!$ is multiplied by $10$, another $0$ will be

		\item We can factor out primes from the elements of the set 11-100, with the goal

		      $2\cdot5=10$.
		\item Between 11 and 100, 17 numbers are divisible by 5 (15, 20, ...100), and 3
		      of them have 5 as a factor twice (25, 75, 100). Therefore we have 20 5's.
		\item It's obvious there are at least 20 2's available in the range, so in total

		\item binomial coefficients count subsets.
		\item When expanding a binomial expression like $(1+x)^n$,
		\item each term corresponds to choosing a subset of size $k$ from a set of size $n$, and
		\item the coefficient of each term is the number of ways to choose that subset,
		\item which is exactly \(\binom{n}{k}\). Thus, the coefficients in the expansion of

\section{Counting Multisets}

\begin{definition}{Stars and Bars}{}
	We can encode the multisets as lists made from the two symbols $*$ and $|$,
	with an $*$ for each element of the multiset, as follows.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{}{}
	The number of $k$-element multisets that can be made from the elements of an
	$n$-element set $X=\left\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\right\}$ is

	\begin{align*}
		\binom{k+n-1}{k}=\binom{k+n-1}{n-1} .
	\end{align*}

	This works because any cardinality-$k$ multiset made from the $n$ elements
	of $X$ can be encoded in a star-and-bar list of length $k+n-1$, having form
	with $k$ stars and $n-1$ bars separating the $n$ groupings of stars. Such a
	list can be made by selecting $n-1$ positions for the bars, and filling the
	remaining positions with stars, and there are $\binom{k+n-1}{n-1}$ ways to
	do this.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Multiset Permutation}{}
	Suppose a multiset $A$ has $n$ elements, with multiplicities $p_1, p_2,
		\ldots, p_k$. Then the total number of permutations of $A$ is

	\begin{align*}
		\frac{n!}{p_{1}!p_{2}!\cdots p_{k}!}
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}


\begin{exercise}{}{}
	How many 10-element multisets can be made from the symbols $\set{1,2,3,4}$?
	\begin{alist}
		\item Let $X= \{ 1,2,3,4\}$, and $|X|=4$.
		\item Let $Y=$ a multiset of cardinality 10.
		\item The total permutations of a k-multiset constructed from a set with
		n-cardinality is
		$$ \dbinom{k+n-1}{k} = \dbinom{k+n-1}{n-1} $$
		\item For this problem $k=10, n=4$.
		\item Therefore there are $\binom{13}{4}$ possible 10-element multisets made
		from the symbols $1\dots4$.

		$$ \dbinom{k+n-1}{k} = \dbinom{k+n-1}{n-1} $$
		$$ \dbinom{27}{2}$$

		\item The question is equivalent to: given a set of cardinality 4, how many
		different multisets of cardinality 4 can be created?
		\item The information about the different number of starting coins is
		irrelevant other than assuring there are at least $k=4$ of each coin.

		multisets of size 15 can be created from a set of 3 balls, which is
		represented by $A$.
		\item Therefore $C=A \cup B$, and $|C| = |A| + |B|$.

		\item Suppose $ x < 0$. Then $x$ to any odd power will be negative, and

		\item Because all of the coefficients to the polynomial terms in

		\[
			x \in \{12 n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}
			\implies
			x \in \{2 n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\} \cap\{3 n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}
		\]

		Suppose $x \in \{12 n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.

		Then $12 \mid x$ and $12c=x$ for some integer $c$.

		Consequently, $2\cdot2\cdot3\cdot c =x$.

		Therefore $2\mid x$ and $3\mid x$, so $x =2d$ and $x=3e$ for some integers
		$d$ and $e$.
		This means that $x \in \{2 n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ and $x \in \{3 n: n \in
			\mathbb{Z}\}$.

		We have shown that
		$x \in \{12 n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
		implies
		$x \in\{2n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
		and
		$x \in\{3n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$,

			\subseteq &
			\{6n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}

		\item Those two subset relationships are equivalent to the following two
		implications.
		\begin{align}
			x \in \{6n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}
			\implies &
			x \in \{2n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\} \cap \{3n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\} \\
			x \in \{2n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\} \cap \{3n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}
			\implies &
			x \in \{6n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}
		\end{align}

		We start with Equation
		\item Supppose $x \in \{6n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. Therefore $6c = x$, for some
		$c\in\mathbb{N}$, which means $6\mid x.$ and also $2\cdot3\mid x$, so
		therefore $2\mid x$ and $3\mid x$.
		\item Because $2d=x$ and $3e=x$, for some $d, e \in \mathbb{N}$,
		it is also true that $\{2n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\} \cap \{3n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.

		Now we will show Equation
		\item Suppose $x \in \set{2n: n \in \mathbb{Z}} \cap \set{3n: n \in
				\mathbb{Z}}$. Therefore $2f=x$ and $3g=x$, for some $f, g \in \mathbb{N}$.
		Because $x$ has as prime factors $2$ and $3$, it also has as a factor any
		product combination of those prime factors, therefore $6\mid x$. Because
		$6\mid x$, we can conclude $x \in \{6n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.
		\item Because we have shown and it follows that
		$\set{6 n: n \in \mathbb{Z}}=\set{2 n: n \in \mathbb{Z}} \cap\set{3 n: n \in

		$\bigcap_{x\in\mathbb{R}}\left[3-x^2, 5+x^2\right]\subseteq [3,5]$.
		\item Suppose $a \notin [3-x^2, 5+x^2]$ and $x\in \mathbb{R}$. Because $x^2$ is
		always positive, then $3-x^2\leq3$ and $5+x^2\geq 5$, which means the range
		is larger than $[3, 5]$. Therefore $a \notin [3, 5]$, and we have proven the
		second implication via the contrapositive.

\begin{exercise}{}{}
	{24a. Prove that $\bigcap_{x \in \mathbb{R}}\left[3-x^2, 5+x^2\right]=[3,5]$.}
	\begin{alist}
		\item
		To prove that $\bigcap_{x \in \mathbb{R}}\left[3-x^2,
				5+x^2\right]=[3,5]$, we need to show that $[3,5]$ is a subset of
		$\bigcap_{x \in \mathbb{R}}\left[3-x^2, 5+x^2\right]$.
		\item Suppose $y \in [3,5]$. This means $3 \leq y \leq 5$.
		\item For any $x \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $3 - x^2 \leq 3$ and $5 + x^2 \geq 5$.
		\item Therefore, $3 \leq 3 - x^2 \leq y \leq 5 \leq 5 + x^2$, which implies $y \in \left[3-x^2, 5+x^2\right]$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
		\item Hence, $y$ belongs to the intersection of all such intervals, $\bigcap_{x \in \mathbb{R}}\left[3-x^2, 5+x^2\right]$.
		\item Therefore, $[3,5] \subseteq \bigcap_{x \in \mathbb{R}}\left[3-x^2, 5+x^2\right]$.
	\end{alist}
\end{exercise}

This proof focuses on demonstrating that $[3,5]$ is a subset of $\bigcap_{x \in
		\mathbb{R}}\left[3-x^2, 5+x^2\right]$, which is sufficient to establish the
desired set equality.
